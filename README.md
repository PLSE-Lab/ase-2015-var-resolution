Introduction
------------

This repository contains the files supporting our recent ASE submission, available
[here](http://www.cs.ecu.edu/hillsma/publications/var-feature-resolution.pdf). Note that we are currently working on improvements to the algorithms, so there are some slight differences between the numbers in the paper and those that are currently generated if you run the patterns on the corpus.

Running Our Software
--------------------

To run this software, you will need to download and configure the PHP PAiR system. This is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/cwi-swat/php-analysis/) and includes installation instructions.

After installing, you should add the PHPAnalysis project as a plugin dependency. More information will be following soon.

The corpus used for this analysis is included as a file in this repository, under Downloads.
